# Candle Firmware

The firmware is currently under active development and is as of now not very functional. The todo below is far from complete but at least gives a hint at what still needs to be done.

## TODO

- [ ] Finalize the programmer protocol.
- [ ] Extract device drivers to a separate library.
- [ ] Improve hardware abstraction/separation so that porting and testing is easier.
- [ ] Write tests for the programmer.
